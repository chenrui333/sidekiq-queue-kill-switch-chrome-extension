# Release workflow for Sidekiq Queue Kill Switch Chrome Extension
#
# Triggered on version tags (v*.*.*). Validates manifest version matches tag,
# builds the extension ZIP, and creates a GitHub Release with the asset attached.
#
# Uses softprops/action-gh-release for release creation because:
# - Single action handles release creation + asset upload
# - Native support for generate_release_notes
# - Well-maintained and widely used
# - Simpler than gh CLI for asset attachment
